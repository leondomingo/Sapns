    <h2>The WSGI nature of the framework</h2>
    <p>In this page you can see all the WSGI variables your request object has,
       the ones in capital letters are required by the spec, then a sorted by
       component list of variables provided by the Components, and at last
       the "wsgi." namespace with very useful information about your WSGI Server</p>
    <p>The keys in the environment are:
    <table>
        {% for key in environment %}
        <tr>
            <td style="font-weight: bold;">{{key}}</td>
            <td style="color: white;">{{environment[key]}}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
